# Venue-finder
Android app integrating with Foursquare to display recommended venues at entered locations

To build the app you will need to create a file named "foursquare.properties" in the root directory of the project.
This must contain the client id and client secret of your foursquare app.
Example:

'''
client_id="Y3FWJRGNKSJGKJPAPIFPHUJPZTSOZVOKLIHV0G"
client_secret="GSNGKJSNRKGJNSKGJRNSJGNSJGNKSJRK3UEJYKXVZ4"
'''

To just run the app, install the apk in the release directory.
